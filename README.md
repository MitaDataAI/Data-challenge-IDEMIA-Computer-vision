# Structure and Submission Process
The Data Challenge follows the standard principle of a “Kaggle Competition,” based on real-world data and a specific problem. We will be able to download the labeled training data and the test data (without labels, of course) from the Data Challenge website. The predictions we compute using the methods of our choice for the test data must be submitted (in the form of a flat file) on the Data Challenge website. They will be evaluated instantly, placing you on the competition leaderboard. Multiple submissions are, of course, allowed.

# Goal
The primary objective is to predict the percentage of facial occlusion in 30,507 images, based on a training set of 101,341 images. The following image illustrates the key aspects of facial occlusion.

Red indicates the occluded (hidden) areas of the face, while blue highlights the visible regions. The final image represents a face with 100% visibility.
